Both take in information by having time to process what they see, however memorization and understanding is triggered in vastly different ways. Let’s take a look at both types:<ul><li><i>Visual-linguistic learners</i> best process information through writing and reading, thrive in lessons presented in text-driven formats, and are quite keen on taking notes. They memorize information through exercises that draw on their linguistic strengths and are able to express themselves sincerely through words.</li><li><i>Visual-spatial learners</i> are still visual learners – but in a strikingly different manner. Words are not their forte; they instead prefer images, infographics, and artistic renderings. The visual-spatial learner is the person who remembers the face of someone he/she met as a young child, despite not seeing the person for decades. They memorize places, sights, and locations by taking a mental picture and using the image to process associated feelings.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips for optimizing the auditory learning experience:</strong></p>',

If in a location where that is not appropriate or doable, they’ll move their lips as the read.

			'Auditory learners typically react well to inclusive activities. Ideation sessions where topics are written on a blackboard, for instance, give them the chance to not only speak their ideas but to see them written down. This triggers memory and often leads to productive deep dives on a specific topic.',

		'description' => 'Kinesthetic learners are a physical bunch. They like to touch, taste, smell, and be active within the lesson in order to best process and remember what they are learning. They struggle when a lesson or activity is too sedentary. There are two types of kinesthetic learners:<br><ul><li>Kinesthetic (movement) learners are all about getting involved. This type wants a deep dive where they are fully engaged with the material and can learn from the experience. External stimulation is the key to success.</li><li>Tactile (touch) learners, on the other hand, are of a similar breed – they have trouble sitting still – but it’s not just about motion. They often opt to write down what they learn just to feel their hand move, and often want to peruse an overview of a lesson before getting into specifics. When traveling, they do much better looking at a map once in the location than prior to arrival, as they can place themselves in the map and figure it out from there.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips for optimizing the auditory learning experience:</strong></p>',
