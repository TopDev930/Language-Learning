			<h2 class="section-title">Learn how Spanish verbs are used in different forms with conjugation tables</h2>
			<p class="section-subtitle">Conjugation tables provide a quick and easy way for you to understand how a verb is used in its different forms, to express when an action is being taken and by whom. Here are the different "views” you'll find and an example chart.</p>
		</header>

		<h3>"Person" view</h3>
		<p>In the table below you can see which "person" each one of the areas represents in a verb conjugation table.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The "<i>1st person</i>" is when we talk about things from your (or a group you are a part of) perspective.</li>
			<li>The "<i>2nd person</i>" is when talking from the perspective of another person or another group of people.</li>
			<li>The "<i>3rd person</i>" perspective is of a person (or group of people) you are talking about.</li>
		</ul>
		<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>1st person singular</td>
					<td>1st person plural</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2nd person singular</td>
					<td>2nd person plural</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3rd person singular</td>
					<td>3rd person plural</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<h3>English subject pronoun view</h3>
		<p>The table below shows the relevent English subject pronouns for each section in a Spanish verb chart. A subject pronoun is the person or thing in a sentence that is performing and action described by the verb. Most of the English subject pronouns refer to people (I, We, Yo, He, She, They). The one exception is "it" which is used to refer to objects, ideas, animals or things.</p>
		<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>"I" form</td>
					<td>"We" form</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>"You" (familiar) form</td>
					<td>"You" (familiar) form in</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>"He", "She", "It", and "You" (formal) form</td>
					<td>"They" and "You" (plural) form</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<hr>

		<h3>Spanish subject pronoun view</h3>
		<p>Below are the Spanish subject pronouns for each area of a verb conjucation chart.  Notice that there are a few forms that do not exist in English.  These include vosotros/as (formal for "<i>you</i>" and "<i>they</i>" that is primarily used in Spain) and Usted and Ustedes (also formal for "<i>you</i>" and "<i>they</i>" used in Latin America).</p>
		<p>Also pay clost attention to the gender you are referring to as that changes the ending of the subject pronoun in Spanish.</p>
		<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>"yo" form</td>
					<td>"nosotros" and "nosotras" form</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>"tú" form</td>
					<td>"vosotros" and "vosotras" form</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>"él", "ella", and "usted" (Ud.) form</td>
					<td>"ellos, "ellas", "ustedes" (Uds.) form</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<h3>View of where verb is used</h3>
		<p>This table below shows you the places in the world where specific Spanish verb pronouns are used.  Keep in mind that this is a general rule and there are parts of the world, that use the "Spain" pronouns that are outside of Spain as well, though they are rare.</p>
		<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Used worldwide</td>
					<td>Used worldwide</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
