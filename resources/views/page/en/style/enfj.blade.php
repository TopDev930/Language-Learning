        <h2>How {{ strtoupper($result -> style) }}'s acquire, memorize and recollect information:</h2>
        <p>ENFJ learners want to pursue information that is helpful to themselves as well as other people. The common good is their motivating factor, and when they see how a project or piece of information is beneficial to all, they pursue it with passion. They desire to engage and interact with a problem, coming at it from multiple angles to find out which solution or path best benefits all involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ENFJ is a fast learner even with difficult topics such as languages, and never shy away from asking questions and looking at conceptual situations in order to find the best solution. Adapting to changing situations comes as naturally as solving day-to-day problems in a concrete environment, as long as the problem is big picture and not just focused on themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            They learn well on their own, even when it comes to challenging material, and are incredibly impressive when it comes to memorization and recall, but prefer to logically work their way through a problem and speak to the steps as they happen. They work well both in groups and on their own, using their community-focused thinking to brainstorm and develop ideas that the group can then provide feedback on. Direct interaction with native speakers in the language learning process is highly beneficial to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the ENFJ’s best qualities in a group or individual environment is their ability to continually apply past experience and learned knowledge towards current situations and future planning. This helps them move projects forward in the right direction and keeps them motivated and engaged throughout the process. ENFJs are consistent and stable during stressful times, and prefer to work in a logical and organized pattern instead of cramming. Long days are doable when necessary for the ENFJ as long as they can get back to their routine quickly.
