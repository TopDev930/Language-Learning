        <h2>How {{ strtoupper($result -> style) }}'s acquire, memorize and recollect information:</h2>
        <p>The ENFP wants to connect with a group of people, understand the issues they're facing, and work towards finding solutions. Learning a new language appeals to them in this way. They're group thinkers and doers, and want the material they learn and the projects they undertake to be towards the common good. When they see a positive reaction or solution, they go all-in towards getting to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          ENFP learners thrive with theoretical material, a unique and desirable trait that greatly benefits them when working with teams and larger groups of people. They don’t care if material is presented in a systematic way; they just want to be able to understand it and see how it relates to the problem they are trying to solve. Once they do, they then take what they’ve learn and rigorously apply it to the goal. They won't rest until they reach the goal or, at the very least, progress has been made. Language learning is an optimal challenge for the ENFP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite their group-centric end goals the ENFP learns very well on their own, without conflicting opinions coming in from multiple different sides. Activities, games, puzzles, and actionable problem solving keep them interested and engaged. They can absorb material in a number of different ways, and then turn it into progress. They thrive on fully comprehending and absorbing a piece of material and then putting it to good use. The ENFP does not evenly distribute effort very often; they instead work on bursts of motivation and have been known to procrastinate.
