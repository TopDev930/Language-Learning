        <h2>How {{ strtoupper($result -> style) }}'s acquire, memorize and recollect information:</h2>
        <p>
            ENTJ learners have a problem with problems. That is, they want to figure out a logical and actionable way to solve theirs, and they eagerly digest information that helps them move down that path. When learning a new language that problem may be communication, or it may be something more specific like enhancing their travels or obtaining a certification. They are keenly interested in learning about current events and popular cultural themes. If a piece of information is in-line with solving practical problems, the ENTJ is all about pursuing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Theoretical information and how it may be used to solve practical problems is of great interest to the ENTJ learner, and they can visualize themselves using language skills in future situations. They visualize how information relates to external situations and have a stunning ability to connect the dots between what has happened in the past and how a piece of information might shape events going forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ENTJ internally processes and remembers information very well, particularly when it is presented from multiple viewpoints and angles. This helps them see how information and situations coexist, and what needs to be done to make that bond stronger or process more efficient. Conversely, the ENTJ loses interest when scenarios don’t interact well with one another.
          </p>
            The ENTJ learner is able to maintain focus during stressful situations and can successfully stick to the plan even when those around them may lose focus. They like organization and a consistent distribution of effort and energy, but they do have a bit of “anti-fragility” when it comes to sudden changes of course.
