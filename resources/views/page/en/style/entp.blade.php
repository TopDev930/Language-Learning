        <h2>How {{ strtoupper($result -> style) }}'s acquire, memorize and recollect information:</h2>
        <p>
            ENTP learners identify the problem and want to know immediately how it can be solved. In the case of language learning, the ENTP is quick to map out their road to fluency, or whatever their end goal is. If subject matter relates to that end goal the ENTP is quick to offer full commitment. The more broad and extensive the possible solutions, the more the ENTP thrives in finding out how to get there. They enjoy intense challenges and attack problems with a rigorous enthusiasm.
          </p>
          <p>
            They love conceptual material such as language learning audio and video files, and enjoy seeing how one piece of communication leads to the next. They are able to perceive different solutions and understand different sides, then take them together to find a path forward. They often bring outside information into a current situation if it will help the process move forward. The ENTP recalls information even when it is tough to organize or remember, as they have a quick process of determining its relevance and assigning the information a useful purpose (if it has one). They work well by themselves as well as in teams, and are good at taking in information from multiple sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once absorbed, the ENTP applies knowledge almost immediately and efficiently changes course towards the solution based on what they have learned. Their way of thinking is often described as being “outside the box,” and because of this the ENTP handles stressful situations with ease. They may not evenly distribute their efforts, but never waver in their goal of learning information and applying it towards solving a problem.
