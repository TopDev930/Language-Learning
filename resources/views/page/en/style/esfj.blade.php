        <p>
            ESFJs are the social ones in the bunch, making them ideal candidates for learning a new language. If they decide to take on a task, their motivation is often driven by a desire to connect with others and improve the working relationship. When they see the social benefit of solving a problem or completing a task, the ESFJ dives in head first and gives it their all.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the ESFJ can quickly put a new skill to good use in solving the problem or task, all the better! They thrive at showing others their ways, and get a serious kick out of watching the things they teach and do used to improve other people’s lives. It’s all about practicality, and about actually taking steps towards the goal instead of just talking about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their independent streak drives ESFJ learners to be strong self-starters and very motivated individuals. They also react incredibly well to emotion and personal connection through storytelling. That said, if presented with information that is unorganized or without progressive steps, they have a tough time grasping it. But when presented with timely and organized logistics, they not only remember the information but can work through it with great efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once an ESFJ grasps the details and layers of a situation, they are able to quickly develop a way forward and convey their opinions and/or directions to others. They prefer a steady flow instead of a hurried rush, which makes immersive language lessons an ideal platform for language learning.
