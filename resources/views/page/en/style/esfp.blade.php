        <p>
            For an ESFP learner, enjoyment and engagement are at the core of whether or not they want to take on a particular challenge or learn new subject matter. The higher the level of excitement and enjoyment the more dedicated they will be, and positive results are sure to follow. They often desire to learn a new language as they understand how it will enhance their travels, as well as their communication with and understanding of others. Part of the enjoyment comes from giving back to others – the tasks the ESFP gets most excited about are often community-driven.
          </p>
          <p>
            ESFPs are visual learners. When they take in information, they process it by looking at it and translating it into a practical situation. They often share their feelings, are very open about communicating, and crave regular feedback. Debates, quizzes, games, and team activities are learning forms that the ESFP excels in. Systematic and logical learning isn’t priority for them; they want to be able to picture the problem and the solution and then act on it. As such, even information not presented in a logical manner can be well-received and turned into an action plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ESFP can excel through moderate levels of stress and chaos, but does tend to be a procrastinator. They can recall info and material quickly and accurately. When the task is completed and they can see their work in action, they feel nothing but pure excitement.
