        <p>
            It’s all about practical experience and knowledge for the ESTJ learner. Their motivation stems from putting carefully developed ideas into place and gaining real-world experience along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Common questions an ESTJ might ask before diving into a project are:
            <ul>
              <li>What is the problem solved by this task?</li>
              <li>How can I most efficiently go about preparing for and executing this task?</li>
              <li>What practical takeaways are there after the task is completed?</li>
              <li>When learning a new language, which aspect of my life will this most enhance?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            ESTJs specialize in logistics. Actions such as planning, mapping, and seeing the nuts and bolts of a project or issue are right up their alley. While visual materials and group activities are beneficial to them, ESTJs learn in a straight-forward manner free of what ifs and imaginative speculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a plan is drawn up, the ESTJ learner can efficiently implement it step by step, checking off bullet points along the way to ensure nothing is overlooked. Immersive language learning works well for the ESTJ, as they can note each step in their learning process. Stressful situation? No problem – overexertion is ok when used to combat an immediate issue. ESTJ learners are more than ready to identify themselves as such – sound like you or anyone you know?
