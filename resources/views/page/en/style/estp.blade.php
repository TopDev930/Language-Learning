        <p>
            Before beginning a project such as learning a new language, ESTP learners identify how that piece of knowledge will help them operate in a more efficient manner. Not until this is identified do they put their all into a project, seeing it as not fit for them or irrelevant. ESTPs are all-in when they see the big picture and long-term benefit, particularly as it relates to addressing important, time-sensitive problems and situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            ESTPs are quick to grasp information and put it into place to solve a problem, such as grasping pronunciation or conjugation in the language learning process. Straight forward applications are preferred, and anyone who shows up unprepared or unorganized is sure to meet the wrath of the ESTP if progress is impeded.
          </p>
          <p>
            ESTPs have an enviable memory for information built around a logical and fact-driven piece of knowledge. They can tie together loose ends in a situation without a cohesive plan of action, and prefer to do so in lieu of pressing forward unprepared. ESTPs can accurately recite what theyâ€™ve learned and how it might impact the problem at hand.
