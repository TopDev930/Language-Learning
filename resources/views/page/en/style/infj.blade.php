        <p>
            The INFJ learner is versatile – both in practice and in action. Learning a language, and the multiple facets required to accomplish that goal, appeal to them in this way. They are able undertake numerous tasks to get the job done and typically develop a deep pool of diverse talents. They are idealistic, often working in sectors such as non-profit and government, and believe firmly in the power of the people to overcome struggle. They are able to think big picture, and develop a framework around information they receive in order to put it into place to reach an end goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            INFJs are equally concerned both with their personal relationships and the overall wellbeing of humanity. Though they appear to be extroverted, INFJs will find themselves burned out after large-scale social interactions and desiring time alone to collect their thoughts. In certain situations, they may come off as socially awkward but actually make incredible public speakers and decision makers. They want to be at the forefront of planning and executing, and are not shy about sharing their thoughts with the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when alone, the INFJ tends to box themselves away from people, often even those close to them. This type of person is as rare as the achievements they so often accumulate, and are a true asset to any team. Their convictions are as strong as their passion for helping others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to INTJ learners, the INFJ builds their systems around people and humanistic values rather than around technological systems or data. They think people first, often to the point of knowing that certain goals or viewpoints may be unattainable in the big picture. Beyond this, the INFJ is similar in learning style to the INTJ. The INFJ is a critical thinker and often pessimistic about things they are taught or told – especially when what they learn is not the full story. The INFJ is a great campaigner, a strong influencer, and despite not always preferring to work publicly, is an excellent team player and leader.
