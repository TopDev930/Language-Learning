        <p>
            Known for seeing the wonder and amazement in just about anything, the INFP aspires to live a life of curiosity and deep emotional fulfillment. The desire to travel and understand other cultures is often a deep driver of the INFP’s desire to learn a new language. They breathe so much life into material that is presented to them that they often appear to be living in a fantasy land of sorts, making an emotional connection that others are not able to see or relate to. This allows the INFP to see problems and their solutions from angles that are often overlooked by other learning styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The INFP can see the benefit in most any task and the beauty in most any situation (or person). They instinctively think good of someone, until there is ample evidence to the contrary. This often leads to significant disappointment or let down, which the INFP becomes accustomed to dealing with over the course of their lives. However, it also leads to bonds that others never take the time to form.
          </p>
          <p>
            INFP learners often have a knack for translating technical data or complicated messages into a language that everyone can understand. This helps immensely with the process of reading and translating across langauges. They aren’t easily frustrated when something is presented in a complicated manner, as they are able to use their imagination to see how it might be intended for use.
