		<h2>How INTJ's acquire, memorize and recollect information:</h2>
		<p>More than anything, INTJ learners want to answer that one big question: why? Their motivation for learning new material or taking on a task revolves around finding out why something is the way it is, and what they need or want to do about it. They want definitive answers to their question, and are willing to do a deep dive in order to find them. The INTJ wants to connect the dots between how a piece of material, such as a foreign language, relates to popular interest and why it is so important.</p>
		<p>The INTJ learner takes in difficult material and processes it in a organized manner, even when the material is delivered conceptually or without real world scenarios. They don’t always respond well to fast-paced delivery of information – the INTJ needs time to soak it in and formulate their thoughts on it. When given this time, they are able to bridge the gap between different but related sets of information and draw up a plan for how to learn, enact, or modify the information to best suit the needs of the general public. This is key in their process of language learning or other major, long-term tasks.</p>
		<p>They form a theoretical base for information, connecting it to themselves and remembering not only the information, but how it made them feels, for many years to come. INTJ learners are proficient with mechanical memorization, but struggle to retain information as accurately this way if it involves small, concrete details. They do much better with thinking about the material in a big-picture manner, instead of focusing on every small detail along the way. When hearing or viewing material multiple times, the INTJ retains it a little better each time, their process of understanding developing along the way.</p>
		<p>The INTJ can then recite the information with incredible accuracy, especially if given a bit of time to organize and process it. They respond very well to visual learning scenarios, and can often recall the small details much more accurately when the visual aid is retained with them and able to be used down the line. Even when the visual aid changes, the INTJ learner is typically able to recall a lot of the information, much like a child who excels at search and find puzzles.</p>
		<p>When working towards a set end goal such as a certification, graduation, or continuation, the INTJ is able to focus at a much higher level than when working towards a result that is less defined. If the curriculum is rigid and challenging, they will dig in and figure out what needs to be done to reach the goal and then put together a plan to make it happen. The end goal provides the ‘why’ that they so acutely desire. They see a challenge as an opportunity, and reaching the goal as the ultimate reward.</p>
		<p>INTJ learners take direction well and can tolerate higher levels of work-related stress when striving for their goals. They are also able to take part in developing the plan of action. The INTJ prefers to evenly distribute their workload throughout the process.</p>
