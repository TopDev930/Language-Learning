        <p>
            ISFJs think in terms of their work and path. When it comes to learning new material, they want to know how it can be readily applied to help them move further down that path. They view their work as practical and want to learn information that fits in line with their long-term vision. If the ISFJ plans to travel to a foreign country, it is often important to them to learn at least the basics of the local language beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ISFJ will dive head-first into learning the material by taking real-life examples and scenarios where that material has been used to form a foundation of the knowledge and build upon it from there. They aren’t concerned with logical flow, and won’t hesitate to take on a task by themselves or work independently to take steps towards progress. They process and memorize information in a mechanical manner, helping them to absorb a foreign language at incredibly quick rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            They often understand material quickly and are eager to apply it to practical situations and specific tasks. They derive much satisfaction from putting what they’ve learned to good use. They efficiently work through stress and prefer to evenly distribute the work load over a set period of time.
