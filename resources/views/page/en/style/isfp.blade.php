        <p>
            ISFP learners respond strongly to the appeal of learning complicated but productive material. For some, that may be how attractive they’ll appear when speaking French in Paris; for others it's the desire to obtain a set of knowledge to complete a well-rounded series or establish a desirable title. They want to enjoy the learning process, as that is part of the beauty of the bigger picture. The ISFP is a visual learner through and through.
          </p>
          <p>
            They grasp practical material quickly through observation of it being used in the real world. The ISFP isn’t overly concerned with the order in which material is presented; they just want to be able to apply it to their life as soon as possible. They benefit from understanding a situation or way of life much more so than by listening to a lecture or studying a book. They learn at a moderate pace and thrive when learning from multiple scenarios or examples rather than one strict format.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a piece of material touches their emotions, they learn it quickly and with a fervent passion. The ISFP thrives through connection to the material and they hold onto what they learn for the long-term. They need thorough details and examples to grasp the nuances of situations. Those teaching or interacting with an ISFP may be impressed by how quickly they put what they’ve learned into use, and how closely they are able to replicate emotions and connect unspoken dots.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ISFP has a moderate ability to work through stressful learning situations and often prefer not to evenly spread the learning process over a set period of time. Perhaps they will cram a hefty dose of material into one long session and then take a break, rather than studying for twenty minutes each day. Despite often resorting to procrastination, they typically do manage to see through the project in the end.
