        <h2>How {{ strtoupper($result -> style) }}'s acquire, memorize and recollect information:</h2>
        <p>
            ISTJ learners become introspective before taking on a task - they focus on its practicality and usefulness. When they have a concrete answer they dive in with full force. For example, if the ISTJ plans to travel to a specific foreign country, they're much more likely to have a desire to learn the local language than if the goal were merely to learn something for the sake of learning. They excitedly look forward to putting knowledge and skills to good use, and this often results in a plan being executed successfully and driven forward by hands-on work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ISTJ best learns material and new skills built around a logical flow and formed from documented, proven information. Even when information is presented out of order or in a seemingly random manner, they absorb the material as long as it is related to the task at hand. Through practical examples, they perceive how the issue will play out in a big-picture format. Contrary to those who thrive in group environments, ISTJs often work best independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            ISTJs have thick skin and can typically maintain composure during stressful times. They plan and spread work evenly throughout a learning process or project, making immersive learning environments and conversations highly effective for them.
