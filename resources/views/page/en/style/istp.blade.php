        <p>
            ISTPs want to know how everything works. This often drives their desire to learn a new language, as it helps them to better understand a culture and how it functions. When they grasp how they can use a set of material being learned, their interest level spikes dramatically. The ISTP wants to be able to work within every system and with every tool they encounter. They are active learners and doers, and aren’t one to sit around and watch others have all the fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ISTP firmly holds on to practical information and concrete solutions and endings. They learn material easily through real-life examples and situations that allow them to try it out for themselves. They work well independently, often building a thought process that works through material or a problem quite efficiently. ISTP learners can recite steps, information, and material for future use even in quickly changing scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            ISTPs take what they learn and actively apply it to real-life situations. They work closely and engage with material, wanting to fully understand how it operates. Immersive language learning environments are typically quite productive for them, allowing the ISTP to process, memorize, and recite what they are learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have a moderate ability to tolerate stressful environments, and have a tendency to work in uneven patterns or spurts.
